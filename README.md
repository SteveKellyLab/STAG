# STAG: Species Tree from All Genes

![STAG logo](stag_logo.png)

STAG is a tool to infer a species tree from a set of gene trees. Its major advantage is that it can use all gene families as input to the species tree inference rather than just one-to-one orthologues that almost all other methods are limited to. In many cases this provides significantly more data on which to base species tree inference.
